## 1. Introduction

### Problem Statement and Objectives

Speech and language disorders affect millions of children worldwide, requiring early intervention and consistent assessment to ensure proper development. Traditional phonological assessment methods often lack engagement and accessibility, making it challenging for both therapists and children to maintain consistent practice sessions.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Develop an engaging, child-friendly phonological assessment tool
- Implement real-time speech recognition and analysis capabilities
- Create a comprehensive progress tracking system
- Design an intuitive interface suitable for both professionals and children
- Provide multiple assessment categories (Rhyming, Syllables, Segmenting, Blending, Sound Recognition)

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility through Flutter framework
- Implement local data storage for privacy and offline functionality
- Create an interactive 3D avatar system for enhanced user engagement
- Develop a scalable architecture for future feature additions
